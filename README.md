# Cheffie- Bringing restaurant quality food right to you door.

Check it out live on Heroku [Cheffie](https://cheffie.herokuapp.com/)!

During the pandemic I while learning programming, I worked as a private chef. In that time I was sharing menu's for the family i worked for over google docs.
I wanted to create a UI for a chef to upload their menu with photos and ingriedients list for their customer to choose from. Once a customer places an order the chef
will get an updated shopping list consisting of all ordered menu items with a current count and the ingriedients that the chef has provided.
If I had this web application when I was working it would of made my life much easier which was the driving force behind this project.
